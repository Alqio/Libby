    This function is used to get a numerical value for how similar two strings
    are. It is inspired by the _fuzzywuzzy_ module, but as we are currently 
    only using the _ratio_ function from the module, we decided to recreate the
    function instead of including the whole module to the project. 

    If two strings are totally equal the answer will be `100`, and if they are
    totally unsimilar the answer will be `0`. However, as we created this 
    function "ourselves" for reason that we do not want to include external
    modules, the function is not commutative. This would require the module
    _python-Levensthein_ as explained in the _fuzzywuzzy_ GitHub pull request
    section: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy/issues/173
