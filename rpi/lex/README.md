# Lex implementation

Only works on Raspberry Pi 3 currently. Use the script from the install folder
to install requirements. Remember to also update the /.aws/credentials file
after running the script.
After that, you can simply run the command on the folder python

$ python3 run.py

or if you wish to test it without snowboy,

$ python3 run_no_snowboy.py
